Final Project for Tangible User Interfaces, UC Berkeley School of Information


Abstract:
While wearable devices are playing a larger and larger role in HCI, particularly commercial HCI, there are also increasing opportunities for designing new physical interactions with technologies that do not require any additional component on the individual. Our research focuses on converting passively captured information about emotional states and energy levels in one space and converting that information to actions taken by a user in another physical space. In particular, we limit our case study to developing a system at UC Berkeley’s South Hall. This prototype only permits entry from a hallway to a student lounge when the participant matches the energy level and emotional state of the lounge, as directed by embedded devices in the hall. We demonstrate through this case study that tangible interfaces in the built environment can not only inform users but also drive changes in users’ emotional states.
